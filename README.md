Quadruped kinematics is a C++ library created to handle operations on a quadruped robot. There are no external dependencies like eigen3 or another C++ math library needed.
This project uses `std::vector` to create matrices. You can adapt this library to your needs.

> **Here are the last steps to complete in order to enter a stable version of this repository:**
> * ~~Program an algorithm to find the inverse of a 4x4 matrix based on the std::vector~~
> * Run tests to verify that the entire program is working properly (90% test finished)
